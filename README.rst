pyiat
=================

pyiat is a Python package to analyze data from the Implicit Association Test (IAT) consistent with the standard IAT scoring algorithm (Greenwald et al., 2003) and Brief IAT scoring algorithm (Nosek et al., 2014). pyiat requires that data are in a pandas DataFrame.

Features
--------

pyiat currently supports:

* Analysis of the IAT and Brief IAT (BIAT) 
* IAT can be analyzed with weighted or unweighted algorithm
* BIAT can include 1, 2, or 3 blocks 
* Obtain D scores for each stimulus (e.g. word)
* Output includes overall error percentage as well as error percentages by block (if using a weighted score) and by condition 
* Same output (overall, by block, by condition) for trials considered too fast or too slow
* Can set reaction time for trials considered too fast or too slow
* Can set cutoffs for error/too fast/too slow flags indicating that a participant is excluded for poor performance
* Can print output to Excel 
* Can return the total number and percentage of trials removed because they were too fast or too slow
